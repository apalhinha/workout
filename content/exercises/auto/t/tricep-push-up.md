intro: ["The Triceps Push-up works shoulders and chest but, mainly, the Triceps. The name comes from this fact.", "The key difference for the regular push-up is that the fingers point forward, thus the elbows point back. Differently from the regular push-up with the elbows opened, this ensures focus on the triceps."]
steps: ["Start in a plank position, arms straight, hands below your shoulders or ahead of them.", "Fingers should point ahead, feet shoulder-with, core straight and engaged.", "Bend your elbows lowering your body. Elbows should be pointed back, close to your body.", "Lower your self until the elbows touch the ground.", "Push your arms against the ground, lifting your body back up."]
hints: ["In case your hands are closer or below shoulders, keep elbows close to the body when going down. This ensures focus on triceps.", "Lower until the elbow touches the ground.", "Placing the hands makes the exercise harder."]
benefits: ["Strengthen the Triceps.", "Strong triceps bring stability to shoulders and elbows.", "Improves arm flexibility and range of motion."]
