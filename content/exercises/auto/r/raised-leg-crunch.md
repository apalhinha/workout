description: "How-to, correct form, instructions and hints to perform Raised Leg Crunch. Similar exercises and video demo"
intro: ["Similar to the regular crunch, this exercise increases the intensity of it by removing the leg support."]
steps: ["Lie down on your back.", "Place your hands behind your head.", "Bring your legs up 45 degrees.", "Lift your head, shoulders and shoulder blades off the floor, exhaling when going up.", "Slowly lower your upper body back to the floor, inhaling.", "Keep your legs always in the same position.", "This is one repetition."]
hints: ["Avoid moving or swinging your legs.", "Cross your legs if you have difficulties keeping then steady.", "The movement should come from contracting the abs, not swaying your body."]
benefits: ["Strong abs are the foundation of many daily moves such as carrying any object or just raising yourself.", "A strong core is a requisite for many exercises.", "This variant of the crunch increases the impact on affected muscles."]
counting: ["Get a list of crunch variations, ensure some variation on your daily routine with a rigid number of reps, say 20 than 30 and so on."]
