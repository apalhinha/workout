Pull your hips up, making a V-shape. This is the start position.", "Bend your elbows away from your body, allowing the head to nearly touch the ground in between your hands.", "Inhale while going down.", "Straighten your elbows and arms again, returning to the original V-shape we started with.", "Exhale while going up."]
hints: ["Warm-up before starting.", "The more accentuated the V position, harder the exercise. Keep core and glutes engaged."]
