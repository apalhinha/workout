intro: ["For the negative Pull-up you use some support such as a box or chair, to raise your chin to the bar level. The exercise is focused on the descent part of the pull-up, and an excellent preparation for the regular pull-up."]
steps: ["Stand on a box or chair and put yourself in the pull-up position, chin above the bar.", "Slowly straighten your arms, taking 10 to 15 seconds to come to the lower position.", "Finish only when your arms are fully extended.", "This is one repetition."]
hints: ["Instead of using a chair you can also jump to the bar.", "Focus on your form keeping your body straight and core engaged.", "Avoid balancing."]
benefits: ["Great preparation for the regular pull-up.", "improves grip strength.", "Helps building body control and preparation."]
counting: ["Measure the number of seconds you take coming down. The longer the better. Count 'hanging exercises' in a period and include this one in your list."]
