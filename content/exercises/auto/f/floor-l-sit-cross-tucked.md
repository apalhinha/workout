intro: ["Exercise is a preparation for the Floor L-Sit. It requires strong shoulders and abs, although other muscles are also involved."]
steps: ["Sit on the floor, legs crossed.", "Put your hands on the floor, near the hips.", "Press your shoulders down with your arms straight so that the hips stays of the ground.", "While pressing shoulders down, your head should be as far as possible from the shoulders.", "Raise your knees enough to have your feet off the ground."]
hints: ["Prepare shoulders and abs for this exercise.", "When starting, to be able to hold the position for a few seconds is already a great exercise.", "Exercise is easier in a hard ground such as rock or cement, opposite to a soft ground such as a grass field."]
benefits: ["Overall strength, focus on shoulders and abs."]
counting: ["Count the seconds you can hold, accumulating in a period (session, day, week).", "Set an accumulated goal for a workout session, say 60 seconds, and do the necessary repetitions to reach that goal.", "Perform this every time you sit on the floor, using a given time that is either increased or maintained."]
