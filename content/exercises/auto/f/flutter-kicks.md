description: "How-to, correct form, instructions and hints to perform Flutter Kicks. Similar exercises and video demo"
intro: ["Exercise is simple and requires minimal technique.", "A few repetitions can be done by any one, even without preparation. When used with longer repetitions can become a serious exercise."]
steps: ["Lay down on your back, hands facing the ground near the hips.", "Raise one leg up to 45 degrees keeping the straight position.", "Bring it back while raising the other leg.", "Count each time one of the legs is up."]
hints: ["Avoid bending your knees.", "You may place the hands slightly under the glutes t make the position more comfortable.", "Extend feet inline with the straight leg."]
benefits: ["Easy core exercise where repetitions can be increased for major effect.", "A strong core improves balance and posture, facilitates many daily moves."]
counting: ["Start small cycles of 20 repetitions, increase as you feel comfortable.", "Exercise can be done every time you lay down, such as in bed or by the sun.", "Because it's an easy exercise it allows challenges of big numbers, such as 10 000 repetitions for one month."]
