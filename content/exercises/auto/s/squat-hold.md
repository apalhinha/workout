description: "How-to, correct form, instructions and hints to perform Squat hold. Similar exercises and video demo"
intro: ["Lower yourself into a squat position and stay there. This is an isometric exercise, surprisingly hard after 1 or 2 minutes, unless you have strong quads and glutes."]
steps: ["Stand on your feet, hip-wide.", "Bend knees lowering until the quads are parallel to the ground.", "Stay in this position a few seconds or minutes."]
hints: ["Keep your feet slightly open, but almost parallel.", "Keep your body straight."]
benefits: ["Strengthen glutes and quads.", "Increases hip and ankle mobility.", "Its a discrete exercise that can be done everywhere."]
counting: ["Count the seconds you can hold.", "Measure progress by the duration you support.", "Set a challenge of 60 minutes accumulated for a month.", "Create the habit of doing this regularly, for example when preparing for your tv shows or waiting for the bus."]
