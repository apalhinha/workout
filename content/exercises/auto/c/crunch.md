description: "The crunch is a popular exercise targeting abbs and obliques. Helps building a six-pack abs, as well as tightening the belly. Its a beginner friendly exercise that requires no equipment and can easily be done at home."
steps: ["Lie down on your back.", "Plant your feet on the floor, shoulder-width apart, with bended knees.", "Put your arms across your chest, or behind your head.", "Inhale contracting your abs.", "Exhale and lift your shoulder blades of the floor.", "Lower back remains on the floor, chest and neck relaxed.", "Inhale and return to the starting position."]
hints: ["Don't pull on your neck with your hands.", "Keep your neck relaxed, this is an abs exercise.", "Perform the exercise slowly, with control.", "Don't crunch to high, this is a subtl movement.", "Keep the tension, don't fully relax on the floor."]
benefits: ["Strengthen abdominal muscles and obliques.", "Strong abs are the foundation of many daily moves such as carrying any object or just raising yourself.", "Also a strong core is a requisite for many exercises."]
counting: ["Create the habit of doing some crunch-series right after warmup and before your regular workout.", "Get a list of crunch variations, ensure some variation on your daily routine with a rigid number of reps, say 20 than 30 and so on."]
