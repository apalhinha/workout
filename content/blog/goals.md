This site was created willing to share:
* An extensive collection of workout exercises that show how to make them in proper form
* Related exercises and progressions, alternatives and similar ones for a given goal
* My own and personal workout journey

### Catalog of exercises
When started doing workouts, spent many hours searching on Internet on how to make a given exercise.
With this, I became an exercise's collector.

Now it makes sense to make such list of exercises available to others.
First purpose of this site is to share that [collection of exercises](/exercises/).

### Collections of related exercises
Willing to do harder moves, had to identify which auxiliary exercises can help reaching a specific goal.
Sometimes office-friendly exercises are needed, or easier ones, with a different equipment or alike.

For example, took me 2 or 3 months to do my first pull-up.
In that period a couple of exercises helped me to gain the necessary strength on the related muscles.
Sharing several collections of related exercises is our second goal.
